# Learning Objectives<br>

* Practice making plots with ggplot2
* Create your own theme and use it with plots

# Background

QikBit is a start-up company producing low cost fitness trackers. Their flagship product, the KwikBit Unit1 (spot the mistake on the patent form) reproduces the functionality of the best-in-class commercial fitness trackers, but is cheap to make.  They are currently preparing to pitch to a potential investor and require a selection of charts to include in their presentation and promotional materials.

# Data

The data for this assignment is provided in the `CodeClanData` package.

* `qb_revenue_breakdown`
* `qb_monthly_sales`
* `qb_competitors`
* `qb_device_data`

```{r}
library(CodeClanData)
library(tidyverse)
```

Take a little time before you start to familiarise yourself with the data.

# MVP

## Part 1

1. Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(qb_revenue_breakdown) + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, fill = Product), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "\nSources of Revenue 2018 & 2019\n") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey95"),
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040"))
```


2.	Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.

```{r}
kwitbit_sales <- qb_monthly_sales %>% 
filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")

ggplot(kwitbit_sales) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Amount)) +
labs(title = "\nKwikbit Monthly Sales 18/19\n") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey95"),
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040"))
```


3.	Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.								

```{r}
kwitbit_total_rev <- qb_monthly_sales %>% 
filter(Cashflow == "Total Revenue")
kwitbit_cost <- qb_monthly_sales %>% 
filter(Cashflow == "Cost")

ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = kwitbit_total_rev, aes(x = Date, y = Amount)) +
  geom_line(data = kwitbit_cost, aes(x = Date, y = Amount)) +
labs(title = "\nMonthly Revenue Vs Cost 18/19\n") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey95"),
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040"))
```


4.	Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.

```{r}
ggplot(qb_competitors) +
  geom_area(aes(x = Year, y = Revenue)) +
labs(title = "\nAnnual Fitness Tracker Sales By Company (Last 5 years) \n") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey95"),
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  scale_cf_manual(values = c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040"))
```

5. Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.

```{r}
ggplot(qb_competitors) +
  aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, group = Company) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
labs(title = "\nCompetitor Sales\n") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey95"),
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040"))
```


6. Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.

```{r}
qb_device_data_clean <- qb_device_data %>% 
  unite("hours_mins", hours:mins, sep = ".")

ggplot(qb_device_data_clean) +
  geom_line(aes(x = hours_mins, y = counts, group = device)) +
  facet_wrap(device ~ id) + 
labs(title = "\nKwitbit Step Count Vs Competitors\n") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey95"),
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040"))
```


## Part 2 

Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")
```
