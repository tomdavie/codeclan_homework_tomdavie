1. I want to predict how well 6 year-olds are going to do in their final school exams. Using the following variables am I likely under-fitting, fitting well or over-fitting? Postcode, gender, reading level, score in maths test, date of birth, family income.

Over-fitting as there are 6 variables and likely that'll be 

2. If I have two models, one with an AIC score of 34,902 and the other with an AIC score of 33,559 which model should I use?

You should use the lower AIC score as this indicates a more parsimonious model

3. I have two models, the first with: r-squared: 0.44, adjusted r-squared: 0.43. The second with: r-squared: 0.47, adjusted r-squared: 0.41. Which one should I use?

You should go for the higher adjusted r-squared so model 1 as this takes into account number of variables too. 

4. I have a model with the following errors: RMSE error on test set: 10.3, RMSE error on training data: 10.4. Do you think this model is over-fitting?



5. How does k-fold validation work?


6. What is a validation set? When do you need one?


7. Describe how backwards selection works.


8. Describe how best subset selection works.
